title: Introduction to GraphLog
---

One of GraphQL's largest potential strengths is the usage level insight you can get on individual fields in a query. Surprisingly, there aren't many tools
on the market to help you get this data. Your primary choice is to use apollo server alongside the apollo platform. If you're not in the JS ecosystem or you
don't want to use apollo otherwise, that leaves you without many options.

Enter GraphLog. GraphLog is an open source, self hostable platform for gathering graphql usage data. It allows you to easily determine which depricated
fields are safe to remove or see which fields should be optimized for performance. It's designed to be extendable to work across _all_ major graphql server
implementations.
