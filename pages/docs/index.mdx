GraphLog is a service that provides usage analytics and performance timing for graphql services. This allows provides you with field level information
such as which depricated fields are safe to remove and which fields are slowing down a query. GraphLog is built to be server implementation agnostic so you
should be able to integrate it with any graphql server implementation.
